# 🌙 Moons Neural Network Classifier (PyTorch)

This is a personal project where I trained a neural network using PyTorch to classify data from the synthetic "moons" dataset — a classic example of a non-linearly separable problem.  
The goal was to visualize how a simple model learns curved decision boundaries.

---

## 🧠 What it does

- Uses `make_moons()` from `sklearn` to generate 2D curved data
- Trains a 2-layer neural network on noisy samples
- Tests prediction accuracy and visualizes decision regions
- Creates decision boundary heatmap and prediction plots
